# 🚀 Nano Banana Image Editor - Deployment Guide

## ✅ Frontend Deployed Successfully!

**Live URL**: https://cursor-playground-ab79a.web.app

The frontend is now live on Firebase Hosting with demo mode enabled.

## 🔧 Backend Deployment Options

Since Firebase Functions requires a paid plan, here are alternative options for the backend:

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended - Free Tier)

1. **Sign up** at [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Create a new project** and connect your GitHub
3. **Upload the backend files**:
   - `railway-server.js` (rename to `server.js`)
   - `railway-package.json` (rename to `package.json`)
4. **Deploy** - Railway will automatically detect Node.js and deploy
5. **Get your URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
6. **Update the frontend**:
   - Change `API_URL` in `public/script.js` to your Railway URL
   - Set `DEMO_MODE = false`
   - Redeploy with `firebase deploy --only hosting`

### Option 2: Render (Free Tier)

1. **Sign up** at [Render.com](https://render.com)
2. **Create a new Web Service**
3. **Connect your repository** or upload files
4. **Configure**:
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `node railway-server.js`
5. **Deploy** and get your URL

### Option 3: Vercel (Free Tier)

1. **Sign up** at [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

4. **Deploy**
